# About

An Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) is a fund that can be traded on an exchange, containing a basket of securities such as stocks.
This project analyzes a Kaggle dataset web scraped from Yahoo Finance, containing data on over a thousand ETFs, to determine what ETFs performed the best in the past year.
The insights this project generates include which sectors had the highest returns, what investment type (growth or value) resulted in the most returns, and which managers created the highest returning funds.
